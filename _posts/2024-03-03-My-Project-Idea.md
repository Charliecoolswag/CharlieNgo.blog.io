Since I was a kid I was very fascinated by the games I played and always wanted to know how they were made. As it would simply be impossible to understand every single game I've played I tried to stick to the more simpler titles I've experienced. 
Aaaand with the new release of the Tekken 8 title, a fighting game I've played since I was little I chose for my project idea to be a 2d fighting game, inspired by my interest and the fact that the game had to run on an arcade machine. 

After a review with my supervisors the level of ambition shouldn't be ridiculously high as I still need to complete this game idea within the timeframe of the course and implement functionalites learned throughout the course. 
As I have only completed the Rollaball game my experience of what I could implement was very limited. My supervisors told me that the characters should however do a little more than simply just punch to the side and be done. 

As I had to do this assignment alone I had to think a little out of the box and after some brainstorming I realised that I could make a game feature based on fighting games that switches between 3 characters such dragon fighters z or capcom vs marvel.

To make the game a little funny and special, My initial idea is to make use of the material switch interaction that was used in the rollaball assignt where the color of the player ball could be changed with three colors. 
Inspired by the magic number three I decided that it was fitting to make a fighting for rock, paper and scissors a classic disprute of opposing forces that is known throughout the entire world. 

The idea would be that e.g both players has the same character that can switch between being rock, paper or scissors. The funny thing then is that the fighting mechanics will be 

e.g rock can damage a rock player 
The player can change his player type to the opposing force to rock, paper which the rock can't block against and can't damage back 
The player characters only has about four moves which would be forward punch, jump punch, forward block and head block 
The players can only change their type following a timer in the health UI. This will incentivize them to geuss what type the opposing player will choose to pick, as to create suspense and make a fun and somewhat interested fighting experience with fewer resources. 

Further moves or interactions could then be added to make the game more dynamic and fun but the above will be the main idea for the game.
