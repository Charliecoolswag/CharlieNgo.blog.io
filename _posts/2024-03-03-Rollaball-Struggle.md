As my first assignment with unity game development I had a lot of struggles and uncertainties as to how to tackle game development. 

I was on vacation the first three weeks of the GMD course I brought my Laptop with me to try an keep up with the work that was done throughout the course. 

The very first lesson was to create a Roll a ball game where the player needed to control a ball within a square space with walls and pick several boxes to win the game. 
As I couldn't join class and get help from the supervisors directly I followed the online tutorial for the Rollaball game at [https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball) 

Since it had been some time since I wrote any form of code I wanted to write the scripts from sratch, following the tutorial throroughly to make my first game. 
As I wrote the code without any worryful red lines I proceeded to test my game to try and control the player character. However, as it turned out I could not move my playe character, the ball... 

I checked my code again and couldn't seem to find any difference between my code and the one in the tutorial and therefore proceeded to try and follow further on in the tutorial. 
Uncertain if the player character couldn't move due to a missing plugin or syntax error. 

Not to lose hope I proceeded to follow the tutorial to at least have all the code and ask the supervisor for help later on. 
As it turned out the functionality for the cube objects that the player character needed to pick up was movíng and I was even more confused what I was doing wrong if these lines of code that wasn't dependent on player character interaction was moving. 

A small shimmer of hope that I might complete this game without supervision rose and I proceeded to complete the last lines of code to see if I could spot my mistake earlier. 
After completing the tutorial and writing all the scripts I realised that all the other interactions were player dependent and I therefore if they worked or not. 

I tried to investigate if the Input System package was installed wrong or used wrong in the side panel. However I could't not find any difference with my settings and the tutorial. 
I therefore searched the wide web to save me but the only code I could find would use the transform setting which I was not interested in using. 

Finally I gave up and wrote to my supervisor Jakob who responded very quickly despite our 6 hour time difference (As I was in Vietnam). 

It turned out after reviewing my code that I made a simple syntax error in the OnMove contructor and wrote onMove instead :). 
A habit I may have carried over from my courses writing java code that doesn't use capital letters as the first letter in constructors.

After fixing my syntax error. My game ran smoothly and I completed the Rollaball tutorial!
